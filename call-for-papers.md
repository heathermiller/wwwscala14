title: Call for Papers
---

Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express common
programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly
integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages.

This workshop is a forum for researchers and practitioners to share new ideas
and results of interest to the Scala community.

We seek papers on topics related to Scala, including (but not limited to):

- **Language design and implementation** – language extensions, optimization, and performance evaluation.
- **Library design and implementation patterns for extending Scala** – embedded domain-specific languages, combining language features, generic and meta-programming.
- **Formal techniques for Scala-like programs** – formalizations of the language, type system, and semantics, formalizing proposed language extensions and variants, dependent object types, type and effect systems.
- **Concurrent and distributed programming** – libraries, frameworks, language extensions, programming paradigms: (Actors, STM, …), performance evaluation, experimental results.
- **Safety and reliability** – pluggable type systems, contracts, static analysis and verification, runtime monitoring.
- **Tools** – development environments, debuggers, refactoring tools, testing frameworks.
- **Case studies, experience reports, and pearls**.

Submitted papers should describe new ideas, experimental results, or projects
related to Scala. In order to encourage lively discussion, submitted papers
may describe work in progress. All papers will be judged on a combination of
correctness, significance, novelty, clarity, and interest to the community.

In general, papers should explain their original contributions, identifying
what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and relating it
to previous work (also for other languages where appropriate). Papers in the
last category of the list above need not necessarily report original research
results; they may instead, for example, report practical experience that will
be useful to others, new Scala idioms, or programming pearls. In all cases,
such a paper must make a contribution which is of interest to the Scala
community, or from which other members of the Scala community can benefit.

Publications at the Scala Workshop represent works-in-progress and are not
intended to preclude later publication at any of the main conferences. Though,
follow-up submissions do need to conform to the publication policies of the
targeted conference, which typically equates to significant extension or
refinement of the workshop publication.

**Keywords**: Library Design and Implementation, Language Design and
Implementation, Applications, Formal Techniques, Parallelism and Concurrency,
Distributed Programming, Tools, Experience Reports, Empirical Studies

## Academic Student Talks

In addition to regular papers and tool demos, we also solicit short student
talks by bachelor/master/PhD students. A student talk is not accompanied by a
paper (it is sufficient to submit a short abstract of the talk in plain text).
Student talks are about 5-10 minutes long, presenting ongoing or completed
research related to Scala.

## Open Source Talks

We will also accept a limited number of short talks about open-source projects
using Scala presented by contributors. An open-source talk is not accompanied
by a paper (it is sufficient to submit a short abstract of the talk in plain
text). Open-source talks are about ~10 minutes long, presenting or announcing
an open-source project that would be of interest to the Scala community.

## Proceedings

It is planned to publish accepted papers in the [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/), unless
the authors choose not to. In case of publication in the ACM Digital Library,
authors must transfer copyright to ACM upon acceptance (for government work,
to the extent transferable), but retain various rights (see [ACM Copyright Policy](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy)).
Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their paper
(source code, test data, etc.); they retain copyright of auxiliary material.

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using
the standard ACM SIGPLAN two-column conference style (10pt format). Regular
research papers must not exceed 10 pages, tool demonstration papers and short
papers must not exceed 4 pages. "Tool Demos" and "Short Papers" should be
marked as such with those words in the title at time of submission.

_Note:_ "Short Papers" differ from "Tool Demos" in that "Short Papers" are
approached as short research papers. "Short Papers" are expected to carry some
new insights or contribution, and to compare with related work, as with any
normal research paper. They're simply shorter versions of full research
papers. "Tool Demos" on the other hand are about showcasing a well-developed,
well-documented tool, live, before the workshop. "Tool Demo"s' corresponding
papers are meant to contain an overview of the tool and methodology for the
tool's use. Tool demo papers are less concerned about proving new research
insights, or thoroughly comparing with related work. The Scala Workshop PC
will approach Tool Demos in the same way as the PEPM Workshop PC, detailed in
[PEPM’s Tool Paper Evaluation Criteria](http://www.program-transformation.org/PEPM14/ToolPaperAdvice).

Student talks and open source talks are not accompanied by papers. Therefore,
it is sufficient to only submit a plain-text abstract. Both "Student Talks"
and "Open Source Talks" should be marked as such with those words in the title
at time of submission.
