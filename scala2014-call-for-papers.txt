                             "Scala 2014"

                   the Fifth Annual Scala Workshop
                      co-located with ECOOP 2014
                           Uppsala, Sweden
                           July 28-29, 2014

                           CALL FOR PAPERS

                 http://lamp.epfl.ch/~hmiller/scala2014
========================================================================

Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express common
programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly
integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages.

This workshop is a forum for researchers and practitioners to share new ideas
and results of interest to the Scala community.

We seek papers on topics related to Scala, including (but not limited to):

- Language design and implementation – language extensions, optimization, and
  performance evaluation.
- Library design and implementation patterns for extending Scala – embedded
  domain-specific languages, combining language features, generic and meta-programming.
- Formal techniques for Scala-like programs – formalizations of the language,
  type system, and semantics, formalizing proposed language extensions and
  variants, dependent object types, type and effect systems.
- Concurrent and distributed programming – libraries, frameworks, language
  extensions, programming paradigms: (Actors, STM, ...), performance
  evaluation, experimental results.
- Safety and reliability – pluggable type systems, contracts, static analysis
  and verification, runtime monitoring.
- Tools – development environments, debuggers, refactoring tools, testing
  frameworks.
- Case studies, experience reports, and pearls.

Submitted papers should describe new ideas, experimental results, or projects
related to Scala. In order to encourage lively discussion, submitted papers
may describe work in progress. All papers will be judged on a combination of
correctness, significance, novelty, clarity, and interest to the community.

In general, papers should explain their original contributions,
identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and relating it to previous work (also for other
languages where appropriate). Papers in the last category of the list
above need not necessarily report original research results; they may
instead, for example, report practical experience that will be useful
to others, new Scala idioms, or programming pearls. In all cases, such
a paper must make a contribution which is of interest to the Scala
community, or from which other members of the Scala community can
benefit.

Publications at the Scala Workshop represent works-in-progress and are
not intended to preclude later publication at any of the main
conferences. Though, follow-up submissions do need to conform to the
publication policies of the targeted conference, which typically
equates to significant extension or refinement of the workshop
publication.

KEYWORDS: Library Design and Implementation, Language Design and
Implementation, Applications, Formal Techniques, Parallelism and
Concurrency, Distributed Programming, Tools, Experience Reports,
Empirical Studies


Academic Student Talks
======================

In addition to regular papers and tool demos, we also solicit short student
talks by bachelor/master/PhD students. A student talk is not accompanied by a
paper (it is sufficient to submit a short abstract of the talk in plain text).
Student talks are about 5-10 minutes long, presenting ongoing or completed
research related to Scala.


Open Source Talks
=================

We will also accept a limited number of short talks about open-source projects
using Scala presented by contributors. An open-source talk is not accompanied
by a paper (it is sufficient to submit a short abstract of the talk in plain
text). Open-source talks are about 5-10 minutes long, presenting or announcing
an open-source project that would be of interest to the Scala community.


Proceedings
===========

It is planned to publish accepted papers in the ACM Digital Library, unless
the authors choose not to. In case of publication in the ACM Digital Library,
authors must transfer copyright to ACM upon acceptance (for government work,
to the extent transferable), but retain various rights (see ACM Copyright
Policy. Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their paper
(source code, test data, etc.); they retain copyright of auxiliary material.


Submission Details
==================

* Abstract Submission: April 30, 2014
* Paper Submission   : May 7, 2014
* Author Notification: June 9, 2014
* Final Papers Due   : June 23, 2014

All deadlines are at 23:59 American Samoa time (UTC-11).

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using
the standard ACM SIGPLAN two-column conference style (10pt format). Regular
research papers must not exceed 10 pages, tool demonstration papers and short
papers must not exceed 4 pages. "Tool Demos" and "Short Papers" should be
marked as such with those words in the title at time of submission.

Note: "Short Papers" differ from "Tool Demos" in that "Short Papers" are
approached as short research papers. "Short Papers" are expected to carry some
new insights or contribution, and to compare with related work, as with any
normal research paper. They're simply shorter versions of full research
papers. "Tool Demos" on the other hand are about showcasing a well-developed,
well-documented tool, live, before the workshop. "Tool Demo"s' corresponding
papers are meant to contain an overview of the tool and methodology for the
tool's use. Tool demo papers are less concerned about proving new research
insights, or thoroughly comparing with related work. The Scala Workshop PC
will approach Tool Demos in the same way as the PEPM Workshop PC, detailed in
PEPM's Tool Paper Evaluation Criteria
(see http://www.program-transformation.org/PEPM14/ToolPaperAdvice).

Student talks and open-source talks are not accompanied by papers. Therefore,
it is sufficient to only submit a plain-text abstract. Both "Student Talks"
and "Open Source Talks" should be marked as such with those words in the title
at time of submission.

Submission is via EasyChair: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scala2014
