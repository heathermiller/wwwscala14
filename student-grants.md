title: Student Grants
---

Thanks to the generosity of our sponsors, a limited number of per-student
grants will be available so as to support students who are presenting papers
or giving student talks.

Students selected to receive support will have the choice to receive either:

- a full ECOOP student registration (good for the workshop, ECOOP and other co-located events),
- or a workshop-only registration + some support for obtaining local student lodging for the duration of the Scala Workshop.

All student talks will automatically be considered for support. If you're a **student first-author** of a Scala workshop paper, please send an email to the workshop organizers with the following information:

- Your name
- Your institution
- Your student status (e.g. 1st year master's student)
- Description of need (why your research group/advisor can't help cover your travel costs)
